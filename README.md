# Employee Reviews
Create classes to track employees and their departments, interpret employee reviews, and give raises to those with good reviews.

### Part One
Use employee class and/or department class to:
* Create a new department(given its name).
* Create a new employee (given their name, email address, phone number, and salary).
* Add an employee to a department.
* Get an employee's name.
* Get an employee's salary.
* Get a department's name.
* Get a total salary for all employee's in a department.
* Add employee review text to an employee.
* Mark whether an employee is performing satisfactorily.
* Give a raise to an individual.
* Give raises to a department's employees. Only give raises to employees that are performing satisfactorily.

### Part Two
Modify department method used to give out raises. Use a block to specify which employees are eligible for raises.

### Part Three
Use regular expressions to scan text of an employee review and determine if the employee is performing satisfactorily or not.

#### Estimate for amount of time to complete each part
* Part One: 4 hours (actual time: 4 hours)
* Part Two: 2 hours (actual time: 1 hour)
* Part Three: 5 hours (actual time: 4 hours)
I feel like my estimates were pretty on target. The hardest part for this assignment was figuring out
regex, but overall it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be.
